# 1. Economics and Praxeology

Mises starts the chapter with a reflection on the old systems of science and its evolution.

>But economics opened to human science a domain previously inaccessible and never thought of. The discovery of a regularity in the sequence and interdependence of market phenomena went beyond the limits of the traditional system of learning. It conveyed knowledge which could be regarded neither as logic, mathematics, psychology, physics, nor biology.

He then goes to explain how previous philosophers treated the study of human
nature as if humanity was a monolith entity, and saw human action as a game of
good or bad.

>Philosophers had long since been eager to ascertain the ends which God or Nature was trying to realize in the course of human history. 


>What was needed in order to construct the ideal society, they thought, were good princes and virtuous citizens. With righteous men any utopia might be realized.

Then, the "discovery of the inescapable interdependence of market phenomena overthrew this opinion."

>They learned with stupefaction that there is another aspect from which human action might be viewed than that of good and bad, of fair and unfair, of just and unjust.

>In the course of social events there prevails a regularity of phenomena to which man must adjust his actions if he wishes to succeed

>It is futile to approach social facts with the attitude of a censor who approves or disapproves from the point of view of quite arbitrary standards and subjective judgments of value.

>One must study the laws of human action and social cooperation as the physicist studies the laws of nature. 

>Human action and social cooperation seen as the object of a science of given relations, no longer as a normative discipline of things that ought to be--this was a revolution of tremendous consequences for knowledge and philosophy as well as for social action.

>For a long time men failed to realize that the transition from the classical theory of value to the subjective theory of value was much more than the substitution of a more satisfactory theory of market exchange for a less satisfactory one.

Mises finishes the chapter with an initial definition of Praxeology.

>It is much more than merely a theory of the “economic side” of human endeavors and of man’s striving for commodities and an improvement in his material well-being.

>It is the science of every kind of human action.

>Choosing determines all human decisions. In making his choice man chooses not only between various material things and services. All human values are offered for option. All ends and all means, both material and ideal issues, the sublime and the base, the noble and the ignoble, are ranged in a single row and subjected to a decision which **picks out one thing and sets aside another**. Nothing that men aim at or want to avoid remains outside of this arrangement into a unique scale of gradation and preference. The modern theory of value widens the scientific horizon and enlarges the field of economic studies.

>Out of the political economy of the classical school emerges the general theory of human action, praxeology. The economic or catallactic problems are embedded in a more general science, and can no longer be severed from this connection. No treatment of economic problems proper can avoid starting from acts of choice; economics becomes a part, although the hitherto best elaborated part, of a more universal science, praxeology.
