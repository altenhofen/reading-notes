# 1. Economics and Praxeology

> Philosophers had long since been eager to ascertain the ends which God or Nature was trying to realize in the course of human history. 

>They learned with stupefaction that there is another aspect from which human action might be viewed than that of good and bad, of fair and unfair, of just and unjust.

>In the course of social events there prevails a regularity of phenomena to which man must adjust his actions if he wishes to succeed

>One must study the laws of human action and social cooperation as the physicist studies the laws of nature. Human action and social cooperation seen as the object of a science of given relations, no longer as a normative discipline of things that ought to be--this was a revolution of tremendous consequences for knowledge and philosophy as well as for social action.
